## Quick start

**Option A — download a ready-made build (no git needed):** grab the zip for
your OS from the [Releases page](https://github.com/EnMaga/sentinel-foundry/releases),
extract it anywhere, and double-click **`Sentinel Foundry.exe`** (Windows),
**`Sentinel Foundry.app`** (macOS) or the **`Sentinel Foundry`** binary
(Linux). Keep everything together in the extracted folder —
the launcher looks for the pipeline scripts next to itself and builds its
`.venv` there on first run. You still need **Python 3.11/3.12, ESA SNAP and
GDAL** installed (see "Requires manual install" below). The build is unsigned,
so the first launch shows a security warning — see
"Opening the app (unsigned build)".

> ⚠️ **macOS / Linux builds are new and not yet field-tested** — the app has
> so far been developed and validated on Windows. They should work (the
> launcher is plain Python/Tkinter), but if anything misbehaves please
> [open an issue](https://github.com/EnMaga/sentinel-foundry/issues) — reports
> are very welcome.

**Option B — clone and run from source:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EnMaga/sentinel-foundry.git
cd sentinel-foundry
```

**Launcher (recommended — one window, handles setup):**
```cmd
python sentinel_foundry.py
```
The launcher opens a single window with two buttons — **SAR Foundry** (Sentinel-1) and **Optical Foundry** (Sentinel-2). When you pick a tool the first time, the launcher creates the shared `.venv` and installs **that tool's** Python packages (`requirements.txt` for SAR, `requirements_s2.txt` for Optical), then starts it; a per-tool marker means it won't reinstall on later launches. The window also links to the manual, non-Python prerequisites (**ESA SNAP with the Microwave Toolbox**, **GDAL**) — these can't be pip-installed and are needed by SAR Foundry. For a clickable desktop icon, see the next step.

**Desktop icon (optional, any OS):** cloning a repo can't place a desktop shortcut for you, so run this once after cloning to create one with the Sentinel Foundry icon:
```cmd
python install_sentinelfoundry.py
```
It detects your system and makes the right launcher — a `.lnk` on Windows, a `.desktop` entry on Linux, or a small `.app` bundle on macOS — all pointing at `sentinel_foundry.py`.

**Run a single tool directly (optional):** the launcher is the easy path, but you can also start a tool on its own — `python s1_pipeline_ui.py` (SAR) or `python s2_pipeline_ui.py` (Optical). On first run each script creates the shared `.venv` and installs its dependencies; afterwards `.venv\Scripts\python.exe <script>` (Windows) or `python3 <script>` (macOS / Linux) skips the bootstrap and starts faster.

## SAR Foundry — Sentinel-1 GRD → ARD → COG Indices

Converts raw Sentinel-1 GRD scenes into ARD (Analysis Ready Data): calibrated, speckle-filtered, geocoded to UTM, clipped to your AOI.

**Outputs — 5 single-band COG GeoTIFFs per scene, organised by orbit:**

```
output/
  ASC/
    S1_YYYYMMDD_SNAP_AOI_[label]_[speckle]_[dem]_[graph]_A_ASC_VV.tif
    S1_YYYYMMDD_SNAP_AOI_[label]_[speckle]_[dem]_[graph]_A_ASC_VH.tif
    S1_YYYYMMDD_SNAP_AOI_[label]_[speckle]_[dem]_[graph]_A_ASC_CR.tif    # VH/VV cross-ratio
    S1_YYYYMMDD_SNAP_AOI_[label]_[speckle]_[dem]_[graph]_A_ASC_RVI.tif   # 4·VH/(VV+VH)
    S1_YYYYMMDD_SNAP_AOI_[label]_[speckle]_[dem]_[graph]_A_ASC_DIFF.tif  # VH−VV (linear)
  DSC/
    ...
```

`[graph]` records the preprocessing chain (section 2): `sigma0` or `gamma0` for the built-in presets, or — for a custom graph — the imported XML's file name reduced to alphanumerics (e.g. `my_chain.xml` → `mychain`). So a σ⁰ run with no speckle filter on Copernicus 30 m DEM is tagged `none_cop30_sigma0`.

`[speckle]` is the speckle filter selected in section 2b:

| UI selection | Tag in filename |
|---|---|
| Lee Sigma 7×7 (default) | `lee` |
| Gamma Map 7×7 | `gamma` |
| Custom → Lee Sigma | `lee_sigma` |
| Custom → Refined Lee | `refined_lee` |
| Custom → Gamma Map | `gamma_map` |
| Custom → IDAN | `idan` |
| Custom → Boxcar / Median / Frost | `boxcar` / `median` / `frost` |
| Custom → None (no filter) | `none` |

All outputs: float32 linear power, nodata = −9999, DEFLATE compressed, 10 m pixel spacing.  
Optional dB copies (suffix `_dB`) can be enabled in section 9 of the GUI — for display only.

**Custom Bands:** up to 3 user-defined expressions evaluated per scene using numpy. Available variables: `VV`, `VH`, `CR`, `RVI`, `DIFF`, `np`, `NODATA` (all linear intensity). Examples: `VH/VV` · `(VV-VH)/(VV+VH)` · `np.sqrt(VH/VV)`. Custom outputs are always saved as `_lin.tif` and follow the same COG profile as preset bands.

### Preprocessing Graph (section 2)

The GUI lets you choose between two built-in processing chains or supply your own SNAP GPT graph XML.

#### Option A — σ⁰ Standard  *(recommended for flat terrain)*

`snap_graphs/s1_sigma0_standard.xml`

```
Apply-Orbit-File
  → ThermalNoiseRemoval
  → Remove-GRD-Border-Noise
  → Calibration → σ⁰ (sigma-nought, linear)
  → Speckle-Filter: [configurable — see section 2b]
  → Range-Doppler Terrain Correction
      DEM: [configurable — see section 2c]  |  10 m  |  UTM 32N  |  aligned grid
      nodataValueAtSea = false
  → Subset to AOI  → Write (GeoTIFF)
```

Based on Filipponi (2019). No Terrain-Flattening. Correct for flat agricultural terrain (e.g. Po Valley). Simpler, faster, and matches the majority of SAR agricultural literature.

#### Option B — γ⁰ RTC  *(terrain-flattened, more rigorous)*

`snap_graphs/s1_gamma0_rtc.xml`

```
Apply-Orbit-File
  → ThermalNoiseRemoval
  → Remove-GRD-Border-Noise
  → Calibration → β⁰ (beta-nought, linear)
  → Speckle-Filter: [configurable — see section 2b]
  → Terrain-Flattening
      β⁰ → γ⁰  |  DEM: [configurable — see section 2c]  |  nodataValueAtSea = false
  → Range-Doppler Terrain Correction
      DEM: [configurable — see section 2c]  |  10 m  |  UTM 32N  |  aligned grid
      nodataValueAtSea = false
  → Subset to AOI  → Write (GeoTIFF)
```

Based on Small (2011). Radiometrically correct for sloped terrain. `nodataValueAtSea = false` in both TF and TC prevents water canals and drainage ditches from being incorrectly zeroed out.

> **Which to choose?** For flat areas (Po Valley, lowland agriculture) Option A is correct and sufficient. Option B adds value only when your AOI includes significant topographic variation.

#### Option C — Custom XML

Select "Custom XML" in section 2 and browse to any SNAP GPT graph XML on your computer. The pipeline edits the graph at runtime, so your file only needs to define the *processing*, not the I/O paths.

**What the pipeline patches automatically (do not hard-code these):**

- the **`Read`** node's `file` → set to each scene's `.SAFE` manifest;
- a **`Subset`** node → injected just before `Write` to clip to your AOI;
- the **`Write`** node's `file` and `formatName` → set to the output path and `GeoTIFF-BigTIFF`;
- the **`Speckle-Filter`** node's parameters (if the node exists) → replaced with your section-2b choice;
- the **`demName`** on any **`Terrain-Flattening`** / **`Terrain-Correction`** node → set to your section-2c DEM.

**Rules a custom graph MUST follow (or the run fails / produces wrong indices):**

1. **Exactly one `Read` node** (`<operator>Read</operator>`) with a `<parameters><file>` element. Put any placeholder path there — it gets overwritten. Avoid `ProductSet-Reader` (SNAP rejects it before execution).
2. **Exactly one `Write` node** whose `<sources>` points at your final processing step. Leave its `file`/`formatName` as anything — they're overwritten. The AOI `Subset` is spliced in between your last node and `Write`, so the last real operator is normally **Terrain-Correction**.
3. **Output must be 2 bands, in the order VH (band 1) then VV (band 2)**, as **linear** intensity (σ⁰, γ⁰ or β⁰ — not dB). Step 3 reads them positionally (`band 1 = VH`, `band 2 = VV`); if you swap the order or output dB, CR/RVI/DIFF come out wrong. Keep `selectedPolarisations` = `VH,VV` on the calibration/noise nodes (this is what the built-in graphs do).
4. Build it the easy way: open SNAP **Tools → Graph Builder**, assemble `Read → … → Terrain-Correction → Write`, and **Save** as XML. Don't add your own Subset (the pipeline adds it) and don't set absolute input/output paths.
5. A `Speckle-Filter` node is **optional** — include it only if you want speckle filtering; its settings are taken from section 2b, not from the file.

The simplest reliable starting point is to copy one of the built-in graphs in `snap_graphs/` (`s1_sigma0_standard.xml` or `s1_gamma0_rtc.xml`) and modify it — they already satisfy all of the above.

### Downloads (section 7)

Download behaviour differs between the two sources:

| Source | Parallel support | Why |
|--------|-----------------|-----|
| **ASF** | ❌ Sequential only (forced to 1 worker) | ASF's server truncates the VV band when multiple connections share the same user token simultaneously — a known server-side bug, not a bandwidth issue |
| **Copernicus CDSE** | ✅ Up to 5 parallel workers | CDSE serves files from S3-compatible object storage (Ceph/OpenStack Swift). Bearer tokens are stateless JWTs — multiple threads share the same token without interference, each gets an independent byte stream |

The **parallel downloads** spinner (section 7) is wired to both sources, but ASF ignores values > 1. For CDSE, 2–3 workers is a good balance between speed and fair-use policy.

**Authentication — CDSE:** refresh/offline token only — no email/password path exists in this app, so a CDSE password is never entered or stored. Paste the token in section 6b; the code exchanges it for a short-lived JWT Bearer token via Keycloak and renews it automatically. The pasted refresh token itself is valid ~60 min from when Copernicus issues it, so generate it right before starting a download. See [how to generate a CDSE refresh token](https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/APIs/Token.html) (the token-generation request returns a `refresh_token` field alongside the access token).

**Connection resilience (both sources):** each download session mounts a `urllib3` retry adapter (exponential backoff; retries on dropped connections, 429 and 5xx). On top of that, each scene is attempted several times with backoff:

- **ASF** — per-scene retry loop (no resume on ASF, so a partial `.zip` is removed between attempts to avoid leaving a truncated archive). Scenes that still fail are added to the end-of-run retry pass.
- **CDSE** — per-scene retry loop **with resume**: the partial download is written to a `.part` file and continued via an HTTP `Range` request, so a connection that drops at 90 % does not start over. CDSE failures are now retried in-loop (previously they were not).

**Integrity checking (around unzip):** corruption — including the silently-truncated VV band caused by parallel ASF downloads — is caught at two points so it never reaches SNAP:

1. **Before unzip** — a fast structural check of each `.zip` (valid archive, `manifest.safe` present, VV/VH bands present and sensibly sized). This reads only the zip index, *not* every byte, so it costs almost nothing.
2. **During unzip** — the extractor verifies each member's CRC (7-Zip/`tar` return non-zero, Python `zipfile.extractall` raises); a CRC failure marks the archive corrupt.
3. **After unzip** — `check_safe()` validates the extracted `.SAFE` (valid manifest, both bands present and not truncated, GeoTIFFs readable via rasterio).

Anything flagged `CORRUPT` is deleted and written to `pipeline_errors/`, so SNAP skips it and a re-run re-downloads what is missing. Heuristic `SUSPECT` cases (e.g. VV much smaller than VH) are kept but flagged in the log for inspection. The checks reuse `check_safe.py` (see below); if that file is absent the pipeline still runs, just without the extra checks.

**Parallel extraction:** unzipping is I/O-latency bound (a single `zipfile` stream leaves the disk mostly idle), so archives are extracted concurrently (`unzip_workers`, default 3). Each scene extracts into its own private temp dir and is then moved into place with a same-volume atomic rename, so SNAP never sees a half-extracted `.SAFE`. The pipeline prefers a **native extractor** — **7-Zip** (`7z`, auto-detected on `PATH` or under `C:\Program Files\7-Zip\`) or **bsdtar** on Windows/macOS — which is markedly faster than Python's `zipfile` on large Sentinel products; if neither is found it falls back to `zipfile` automatically (install 7-Zip to speed this up). Products extracted outside the app (e.g. manually with 7-Zip, which drops the `.SAFE` suffix) are normalised back to `*.SAFE` before SNAP discovery.

A real-time throughput monitor samples directory growth every second and displays current speed in **Mbps** in the progress bar. Average speed per scene is also logged on completion.

#### Standalone integrity checker — `check_safe.py`

The same checks can be run manually on any folder of downloads (e.g. to vet an existing archive before processing):

```
python check_safe.py "E:\SNAP_Download"     # scan zips + .SAFE dirs (report only)
python check_safe.py . --delete             # also delete anything CORRUPT
python check_safe.py . --no-crc             # skip the slow per-byte zip CRC test
python check_safe.py . --no-deep            # skip the rasterio band-read test
```

With no path it auto-detects the `safe_dir` from `sar_foundry_config.json`. Exit code is `0` if all products are OK, `1` if any are `SUSPECT`/`CORRUPT`. Standard library only; uses `rasterio` for the deep band read if it is installed (run it with the project venv's Python to enable that).

### Speckle Filter (section 2b)

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Lee Sigma 7×7** | Default. Analysis window 7×7, target 3×3, σ=0.9, ENL estimated. |
| **Gamma Map 7×7** | Bayesian filter assuming Gamma-distributed backscatter. Better edge preservation. |
| **Custom** | Opens a configuration dialog with all 9 SNAP speckle filters. Settings are saved between sessions. |

---

### DEM for Terrain Correction (section 2c)

| DEM | Resolution | Notes |
|-----|-----------|-------|
| **Copernicus 30m Global DEM** | ~30 m | Default. GLO-30, best global coverage. |
| Copernicus 90m Global DEM | ~90 m | Faster download. |
| SRTM 1 arc-sec HGT | ~30 m | Classic global DEM. |
| SRTM 3 arc-sec | ~90 m | Broad coverage, older. |
| ASTER GDEM | ~30 m | Good for areas with SRTM voids. |

DEMs are auto-downloaded by SNAP on first use and cached locally. An internet connectivity indicator is shown next to the dropdown.

---

### Area of Interest (section 3)

**Browse for a file** — accepted formats: `.shp`, `.gpkg`, `.geojson`. Any CRS is accepted — reprojected to EPSG:4326 automatically. Multi-polygon files are unioned.

**Draw on map** — click **🗺 Draw on map** to open an interactive Leaflet map (requires `pywebview` — auto-install prompt). Basemaps: Google Hybrid (default), Google Satellite, OpenStreetMap. Drawn AOI saved as `drawn_aoi.geojson` and persists across sessions.

---

### Multi-tile mosaicking

When your AOI spans two or more adjacent Sentinel-1 frames, tiles are processed independently then merged via **seam interpolation**: TC edge artefact rows are trimmed, and the resulting gap is filled with vertical bilinear interpolation between the two bordering tiles. Final output is always a single `.tif` per date+orbit.

---

### Stop button

Pressing **■ STOP** immediately kills the running SNAP GPT subprocess (`Popen.kill()`), cancels pending downloads, and halts the pipeline. The UI resets to ready state.

---

### Retry failed downloads

If scenes fail to download, the pipeline logs the failure and continues. At the end of the run, if **Retry failed downloads at end** is enabled (section 7), the pipeline re-authenticates and retries the failed scenes.

Most download failures are *transient* — a dropped TLS connection or a 5xx from the archive (`Read failed`), not a missing scene. A scene that recovers on retry no longer leaves a stale log behind: the `pipeline_errors/…__download*.error.txt` file is deleted the moment that download succeeds.

**Manual retry (↻ Retry failed downloads).** If a run still ends with download errors — e.g. the archive was down and every attempt failed — click **↻ Retry failed downloads** in the footer. It reads the acquisition dates out of the leftover `…__download*.error.txt` logs, forces the download step on, and re-runs the scene search restricted to just those dates. Already-downloaded scenes are skipped, so only the missing ones are re-fetched. There's nothing to retry if `pipeline_errors/` has no download logs.

---

### Opening the app (unsigned build)

The installers are **unsigned** (no paid Apple/Windows code-signing certificate), so your OS will warn you the first time you open the app. This is expected — the warning is about the *missing signature*, not about the app itself. Here's how to get past it, per OS. You only need to do this once.

**Windows** — SmartScreen shows *"Windows protected your PC."*
1. Click **More info**.
2. Click **Run anyway**.

**macOS** — Gatekeeper shows *"…cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer"* or *"Apple could not verify… is free of malware."*
1. **Right-click** (or Control-click) the app → **Open**.
2. Click **Open** in the dialog that appears.
3. If it's still blocked (recent macOS): **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, scroll to the message naming the app, click **Open Anyway**, then reopen.

   Still stuck? Clear the quarantine flag in Terminal:
   ```
   xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Sentinel Foundry.app"
   ```

**Linux** — no signature prompt, but the file may not be marked executable:
1. `chmod +x "Sentinel Foundry"` (or: file manager → **Properties → Permissions → Allow executing file as program**).
2. Launch it.

---

**Requires manual install:**

| Tool | Windows | macOS | Linux |
|---|---|---|---|
| Python 3.11 or 3.12 | [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) | `brew install python@3.12` | `sudo apt install python3.12` |
| ESA SNAP **(must include the Microwave Toolbox = Sentinel-1 Toolbox)** | [step.esa.int](https://step.esa.int/main/download/snap-download/) | same | same |
| GDAL | via [QGIS](https://qgis.org) or OSGeo4W | `brew install gdal` | `sudo apt install gdal-bin` |

**Installing SNAP correctly** — only three installer choices matter:

1. **Components:** the **Microwave Toolbox** *must* be ticked. (This is the SAR / Sentinel-1 toolbox — named **"Microwave Toolbox"** in SNAP 12 / 13, formerly **"Sentinel-1 Toolbox" / S1TBX** in SNAP ≤ 11.) It provides the `eu.esa.sar.*` modules the pipeline reads `.SAFE` files with. Simplest safe choice: leave **all** components ticked.
2. **Python / esa_snappy step:** leave it **unticked** — not needed. The pipeline drives SNAP via the `gpt` command line, not the Python binding.
3. **Final screen:** **"Extend my PATH"** is optional but recommended (lets you run `gpt` from any terminal).

After install, open SNAP once → **Help → Check for Updates → install all → restart**. Then verify in a new terminal:

```
gpt Calibration -h      (or  "C:\Program Files\esa-snap\bin\gpt.EXE" Calibration -h)
```

Clean operator help = good. A Java `eu.esa.sar...` stack trace = the Microwave Toolbox is missing → see Troubleshooting below. Without it, the `gpt` step fails on *every* scene at startup.

> The app self-checks this: the Dependencies panel runs `gpt Calibration -h` at startup, and if SNAP can't load the SAR operators it marks **SNAP GPT** as failed and **blocks the START button** with a clear message — so you find out before a run, not after every scene fails. (The check spins up the SNAP JVM, so it can take up to a minute on a cold first start.)

**Credentials:** NASA Earthdata account required → [Register here](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/users/new)

**Authentication — Bearer token (recommended):**
1. Log in at [urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/user_tokens](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/documentation/for_users/user_token)
2. Click **Generate Token**
3. Paste into the **Token** field in section 6

---

### Running several runs at once

The launcher (Sentinel Foundry) does **not** limit how many SAR Foundry windows you open — click **Open** as many times as you like, point each window at a different AOI / date range, and they run independently and concurrently. On a powerful machine this is a quick way to process several regions at once; on a modest one it will oversubscribe CPU and RAM and slow everything down, so size it deliberately.

What matters is memory. Each SAR Foundry window runs its own SNAP jobs, configured in section **2e "Parallel SNAP Jobs"** (number of parallel SNAP workers, and the JVM heap per worker). The total memory in flight across everything is roughly:

```
windows  ×  workers-per-window  ×  JVM-GB-per-worker
```

Keep that under ~70–80% of your physical RAM, and keep the **total** worker count near your CPU core count (Terrain Correction is CPU-bound). Example for a 32 GB / 8-core machine:

- **One run, fast:** 1 window · 2–3 workers · 8 GB heap (~16–24 GB).
- **Two runs in parallel:** 2 windows · 1 worker each · 8 GB heap (~16 GB).
- **More runs:** drop to 1 worker per window and lower the heap so `windows × workers × heap` still fits.

If you over-commit, you'll see heavy disk swapping, SNAP out-of-memory / "GC overhead" errors, and a net slowdown rather than a speedup. SAR Foundry's Dependencies panel warns when *one* window's `workers × heap` exceeds available RAM — but it cannot see the other windows, so when running several you must do that arithmetic across all of them yourself. Disk matters too: concurrent runs hammer I/O, so prefer an SSD and, where possible, point each run at a different output drive to avoid contention.

### Troubleshooting

**Every scene fails at SNAP with `ClassNotFoundException: eu.esa.sar...` (e.g. `eu.esa.sar.io.ceos.CEOSProductReaderPlugIn` or `eu.esa.sar.commons.polsar.PolBandUtils`).**

Cause: SNAP was installed **without the Microwave Toolbox** (called **"Sentinel-1 Toolbox" / S1TBX** in SNAP ≤ 11, renamed **"Microwave Toolbox"** in SNAP 12 / 13), so the `eu.esa.sar.*` modules (the S1 product readers and the core SAR classes the radar operators depend on) are missing. `gpt` then crashes while loading plugins — *before* reading any data — so the download/unzip steps succeed but every scene fails identically in step 2. This is purely a SNAP install problem; reverting the pipeline code does not help.

Confirm it:
```
"C:\Program Files\esa-snap\bin\gpt.EXE" Calibration -h
```
A Java stack trace mentioning `eu.esa.sar` = the toolbox is missing. You can also check directly — a healthy install has an `s1tbx` folder next to `rstb`:
```
dir /b "C:\Program Files\esa-snap"
```

Fix (clean reinstall):
1. Uninstall SNAP, then delete leftovers: `C:\Program Files\esa-snap`, `C:\Users\<you>\.snap`, `C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Roaming\SNAP`, `C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Local\SNAP`.
2. Reinstall using the **"ESA SNAP — All Toolboxes"** installer and keep **Sentinel-1 Toolbox** ticked.
3. Open SNAP once → **Help → Check for Updates → install all → restart**.
4. Re-verify with `gpt Calibration -h` (should print help, no stack trace), then re-run the pipeline — it skips already-downloaded scenes and resumes at SNAP.

> This commonly appears after reinstalling Windows or SNAP, when a partial component set is chosen.

**`ImportError: DLL load failed … An Application Control policy has blocked this file` (e.g. importing `rasterio`), or "Smart App Control has blocked part of this app".**

Cause: **Windows 11 Smart App Control** (part of Windows Security) blocks binaries it doesn't trust. The geo stack ships **unsigned native libraries** (rasterio's `_base.pyd`, the GDAL DLLs, etc.), so once Smart App Control is enforcing it can block them and every `import rasterio` fails — which the dependency panel then reports as `Missing: rasterio`. It tends to (re)appear after the packages are (re)installed, because the freshly written files get re-evaluated.

Fix: **Windows Security → App & browser control → Smart App Control → Off.** No reinstall of the packages is needed — the existing files load again immediately. Verify with:
```
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -c "import rasterio; print(rasterio.__version__)"
```

> Turning Smart App Control off used to be permanent (re-enabling required reinstalling Windows); since the April 2026 Windows 11 cumulative update it can be toggled off and back on freely. On a machine running scientific Python (rasterio/GDAL, SNAP, …) Smart App Control will keep flagging these unsigned libraries, so leaving it off is the practical choice. The only alternative is code-signing every native binary with a Microsoft-trusted certificate.

**Verify downloads independently** at any time with `check_safe.py` (see the Downloads section above).

## Optical Foundry — Sentinel-2 L2A → COG Indices + Biophysicals

Downloads Sentinel-2 L2A from **AWS EarthSearch** (public, no credentials), applies SCL cloud masking, and computes biophysical variables, spectral bands and indices as 10m COG GeoTIFFs.

> **Why AWS and not Copernicus Data Space (CDSE)?**
> The biophysical processor relies on [`satellitetools`](https://github.com/ollinevalainen/satellitetools), which is built on top of the AWS EarthSearch STAC API and AWS S3 public bucket (`sentinel-2-l2a-cogs`). Data access is **completely free and anonymous** — no Copernicus or ESA account needed. Switching to CDSE would require reimplementing the entire search + download layer. Since AWS and CDSE carry the same Sentinel-2 L2A products (ESA ground-truth), there is no scientific difference. The Raster Calculator tab works on any GeoTIFF output regardless of where the data was downloaded from.

### Output filenames

| Situation | Filename |
|---|---|

All outputs: float32, nodata = −9999, DEFLATE compressed, 10m UTM.

**Custom Indices:** up to 3 user-defined expressions evaluated during the pipeline run, after preset spectral indices. Available variables: `B2`, `B3`, `B4`, `B5`, `B6`, `B7`, `B8`, `B8A`, `B11`, `B12`, `np`. All values are reflectance (0–1). Examples: `(B8-B4)/(B8+B4+1e-9)` · `(B8A-B5)/(B8A+B5)` · `B8/B5-1`. Custom outputs are saved under `index=<name>/aoi=<label>/` with the same COG profile as preset indices. Valid for spectral indices only — biophysical variables (LAI, CCC, etc.) always use AWS EarthSearch via `satellitetools`.

### Per-tile mosaicking (cross-MGRS-tile AOIs)

When an AOI straddles two MGRS tiles (e.g. 32TQN + 32TQP), `satellitetools` internally selects only one tile per acquisition, leaving the other half of the AOI as nodata on dates when the selected tile has a partial swath.

The pipeline now performs **explicit per-tile processing**:

1. A direct EarthSearch query discovers every `(tile_id, sat_letter)` pair available for the date.
2. For each tile, a thread-local monkey-patch filters the satellitetools search to that tile only — guaranteeing real data from both 32TQN and 32TQP.
3. Each tile is processed independently (bands, indices, biophysicals, SCL mask).
4. If two or more tile files exist for the same date and variable, `rasterio.merge(method="first")` produces a single mosaic covering the full AOI. Intermediate per-tile files are deleted.

The satellite letter (`A`, `B`, `C`) is extracted directly from the STAC item ID (e.g. `S2A_32TQN_20250325_0_L2A`) — no longer relies on the rarely-populated `satellite_id` coordinate.

---

### Parallel processing

Days are processed in parallel using `ThreadPoolExecutor` (configurable 1–8 workers). Each worker independently queries EarthSearch, downloads band data from AWS S3, applies the SCL mask, and writes COG outputs. All UI callbacks are thread-safe. A real-time ETA is shown based on average seconds per completed day.

---

### Retry on network errors

Failed days are collected during the run. If **Retry failed days** is enabled, the pipeline waits 10 seconds then re-attempts up to the configured number of times. Useful for transient AWS S3 or EarthSearch timeouts.

Nearly all of these are *transient* tile reads: a single MGRS tile drops mid-download (`… tile 34TGR/B fetch: Read failed`), so the whole day is re-queued rather than saving a mosaic with a hole in it. A day that recovers on retry no longer leaves a stale log — the day's `…__process.error.txt` is cleared at the start of each attempt and only rewritten if that attempt fails. (Previously the automatic retry could fix a day yet still list it under "days had errors" in the summary — the error log was never deleted.)

**Manual retry (↻ Retry failed days).** If a run still ends with day errors, click **↻ Retry failed days** in the footer. It reads the failed dates from the leftover `S2_YYYYMMDD__process.error.txt` logs and re-runs *only* those days with overwrite on (so a partially-written mosaic is rebuilt cleanly). Nothing to retry if `pipeline_errors/` is empty.

> **"no data" and "no usable pixels" are not errors — and they are two different things.** Sentinel-2 revisits a given spot only every ~5 days, and its swaths are ~290 km wide, so on most calendar dates one of these is expected:
>
> - **`<date>: no data`** — *nothing was acquired.* No S2 granule was even catalogued for that date over the AOI; the satellite did not image this area that day. This is the plain revisit gap, and it's the most common line by far (a ~5-day cycle means ~4 of every 5 days show it).
> - **`<date>: no usable pixels`** / **`footprint matched but no pixels cover this AOI on this date`** — *acquired, but nothing usable landed on your fields.* A granule **was** found — its 100 km MGRS-tile footprint clips the AOI's bounding box — but after cloud/SCL masking and clipping to the actual field shapes, zero valid pixels remained (the imaged swath grazed the tile edge, or every covering pixel was cloud/NODATA).
> - A **mixed** line like `c01: 28 outputs …; c02: footprint matched but no pixels …` just means one field cluster got usable data that day and another didn't.
>
> All three are skipped silently and never retried. Only a real fetch/processing failure (e.g. `tile … fetch: Read failed`) writes to `pipeline_errors/`.

---

### Skip / Overwrite existing files

- **Skip** (default): if a file already exists on disk, its path is registered (so the mosaic step can include it) but it is not re-downloaded or reprocessed. Efficient for extending a date range or resuming an interrupted run.
- **Overwrite**: all files are rewritten, including mosaics.

---

**No manual installs required** beyond Python. All packages installed automatically on first run from `requirements_s2.txt`.

├─ s2_pipeline_ui.py            # Optical Foundry  (Sentinel-2 L2A → COG indices)
├─ check_safe.py                # download integrity checker (.zip / .SAFE)

```

Each tool finds its resources (graphs, requirements, icon, config) next to itself, so the layout is intentionally flat — keep these files in the same folder. The shared `.venv/` and `sar_foundry_config.json` are created at runtime and are git-ignored.

## 🚧 In development

- **One-click builds** — Windows, macOS and Linux builds are on the [Releases page](https://github.com/EnMaga/sentinel-foundry/releases) (macOS/Linux not yet field-tested — feedback welcome). Python, SNAP and GDAL remain external prerequisites.
- ~~**S1 parallel SNAP processing**~~ *(done — section 2e "Parallel SNAP Jobs": configurable workers + JVM heap; you can also open several SAR Foundry windows from the launcher — see "Running several runs at once")*
- **S1-SliceAssembly** — ESA's recommended approach to eliminate tile seams: assemble adjacent GRD slices *before* calibration. Implementation complete but disabled due to JAI tile-cache `NullPointerException` in SNAP 12.
- **Copernicus CDSE for S2** — *not planned*. S2 uses AWS EarthSearch (free, anonymous, identical data). CDSE S2 would require replacing the entire `satellitetools` search/download layer with no scientific gain.
- ~~**Copernicus CDSE integration for S1**~~ *(done — Download tab, section 6b)*
- ~~**Raster Calculator (S1 & S2)**~~ *(done — 🧮 Raster Calc tab in both UIs)*
- ~~**Custom Bands (S1)**~~ *(done — Processing tab, numpy expressions with VV/VH/CR/RVI/DIFF)*
- ~~**Custom Indices (S2)**~~ *(done — Processing tab, numpy expressions with B2–B12)*

- ~~**Per-tile mosaicking for cross-MGRS AOIs (S2)**~~
- ~~**Parallel day processing (S2)**~~
- ~~**Real-time download speed display (S1)**~~
- ~~**Parallel downloads (S1)**~~ *(disabled — ASF throttles parallel connections causing corrupted VV bands)*
- ~~**ETA / elapsed time display**~~
- ~~**Download connection resilience (S1)**~~ *(done — urllib3 retry adapter + per-scene backoff on ASF & CDSE; CDSE resume via HTTP Range)*
- ~~**Download integrity checks (S1)**~~ *(done — fast pre-unzip zip check + post-unzip `.SAFE` validation; corrupt products deleted & logged; standalone `check_safe.py`)*
